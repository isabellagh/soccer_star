# Soccer Star

Soccer Star app is for people who enjoy soccer. They can create an account and then create their own players (professional players or not). They create a player by uploading a picture, giving a name, position, gender and their own bio. Users should also be able to review players by rating them from 1 to 5 stars, give a title and the content. Everyone can see players' reviews and who created.
If you are looking for a specific player all you have to do is use the search bar and type the first and/or last name of your player.
